📊 Loan Analytics Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Loan Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI to analyze and monitor lending performance. The dashboard tracks key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, average interest rate, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) analysis.

It features Good vs Bad Loan KPIs, a loan status summary grid, and interactive visualizations such as time-series trends, regional analysis, loan term distribution, loan purpose breakdown, employment length analysis, and home ownership insights. The dashboard enables stakeholders to assess portfolio health and make data-driven lending decisions.
